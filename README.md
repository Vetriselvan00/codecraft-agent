# 🛒 CodeCraft Agent  
### Multi-Agent Ecommerce Product Recommendation System (Built with Google ADK)

CodeCraft Agent is a full multi-agent system that analyzes ecommerce product listings,
creates a structured comparison outline, writes a detailed recommendation article,
edits the content based on user feedback, and generates social media posts — all powered
by the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.

This project is modeled after the Kaggle "Agents Intensive Capstone" structure but
fully redesigned for **ecommerce product recommendation** instead of blogging.
